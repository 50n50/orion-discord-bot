# Migration Guide: Monolithic to Modular Bot

## 🎯 What We've Accomplished

Successfully restructured your **5,148-line** `bot.py` into a clean, modular architecture:

### ✅ Created Files:
- `main.py` - New entry point for the bot
- `config.py` - All configuration and constants
- `data_manager.py` - JSON file operations and data management
- `events.py` - All Discord event handlers
- `commands/moderation.py` - Basic moderation commands
- `commands/utility.py` - Information and utility commands
